#Homework 9 AY 250 Spring 2012  
Author: Cameron Bates

Prior to running the hw9.py script start an ipython cluster with the desired
number of engines. This can be done using the command:  
ipcluster start -n 4  
This starts 4 engines. The output of running the script on a 2011 Macbook air
with a 1.8GHz dual-core processor with hyperthreading(4 effective threads) is
included in performanceplot.pdf. Running the hw9.py will produce the same 
output figure.
