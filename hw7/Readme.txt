AY 250 Homework 7 Spring 2012

This homework consists of a django based website(tested with django 1.4 and 1.3.1) that one can upload latex .bib files to. The website then creates a database with the data from the file. That database can then be queried using standard mysql query statements. This site also requires pybtex 0.15 for .bib file parsing. It can be run by entering the homework7 directory and running the commmand python manage.py runserver.
