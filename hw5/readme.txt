Prior to running the database generating function initdb is it necessary to create the folder pictures within the directory so that images can be downloaded. In addition the csv race data must be located in the folder race_prediction_data. Once both of these things have been accomplished then initdb() can be run. This creates all three tables in the local database elections.db. 

part e) In order to generate the plots of whether a candidate born in the north or south will win run the function mdall(). The plots repnomns.png, repvp.png and presns.png show the comparative probabilities for each race.

part f) In order to generate the plot of the difference between the sum of the probabilities of all candidates winning and 1 run the function pall(). The figure totalprob.png was created using this function. On May 11, 2011 where the first spike is Newt Gingrich announced his candidacy. The other major spike was on Sept 15th 2011 when the GOP won several seats previously held by democrats. The efficiency of the trading markets is not perfect because for there is a period of time after news comes out where people have not yet decided on the new valuation of different outcomes.

A sample database file and folder of pictures are included as well as the race_prediction_data folder.
