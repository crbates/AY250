# This is homework 2 for AY250 spring 2012

Author: Cameron Bates

All code is contained in hw2.py. Running this code will execute all subparts of this problem. Specific answers to questions are:

b. Histogram is laplace.png(this will also be generated by the script). The result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was a distance of ~0.03. This implies that the data was drawn from a Laplace distribution.
c. The acceptance rate is 0.686. This the same within the margin of error as the acceptance rate from part b.
d. The continuous distribution I chose was : abs(x)*math.exp(-(x**2))*2 I sampled it using a maxwell-boltzmann distribution. The figure is labeled "submaxwell.png" it will also be created by the script.
