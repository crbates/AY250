AY250 Homework 4 
Author: Cameron Bates

Part 1: I was responsible for the client and Ross Barnowski was responsible for the server. Running the script client.py will connect to the remote host and manipulate the image cat.png. It will run all three remote methods reconstructing the original image and saving both the modified and reconstructed versions.

Part 2: The script for this section is called audio.py it will run on the folder sound_files and determine the notes in files 1.aif through 12.aif. It prints the notes in each file to the command line. This script requires scikits-audiolab if you happen to use arch linux it's in the AUR here: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=31254 otherwise the onyl dependency appears to be numpy. The pypi location is: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.audiolab/0.11.0. It's also available using easy_install scikits.audiolab.
